This application demonstrates a classic machine learning task - handwritten digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow.

# Project Overview
The project features an interactive GUI application that allows users to:

1. Draw digits on a black canvas
2. Click the "Recognize" button to identify the drawn digit
3. Clear the canvas using the "Clear" button

The application utilizes a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset, the standard benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
